    '''Design the function es6(ftext) which returns a string of characters
    made only of '0's or '1's.  The string has as many characters '0'
    or '1' as the number of rows in the text file whose path is given
    by ftext. The text file contains rows of integers separated by an
    arbitrary number of spaces.
    The i-th character of the string is '0' if the sum of the integers
    present in the i-th row of the file is an even number.
    The i-th character of the string is '1' if the sum of the integers
    in the i-th row of the file is an even number.
