# %%  ---- FUNC1 ----
''' func1: 2 points

A dictionary D is provided as input. D has integer keys and its values are
lists of strings with repetitions.

D = {4: ["c", "h", "f", "g", "e"], 2: ["a", "z", "b", "w"], 0: ["a", "b", "a"]}

Write the function func1(D) that builds and returns the
list W that contains the values obtained by taking, for each key K in D,
the corresponding item from the list L associated to K;
before picking an item, the function sorts L in reversed order.

Given the D as defined above, the function returns:

    W = ["c", "b", "b"]

as the first list sorted in reversed order is ["h", "g", "f", "e", "c"],
and its 4th item is "c"; the second list is ["z", "w", "b", "a"], and its
2nd item is "b"; the third list is ["b", "a", "a"] and its 0th item is "b".

''' func2: 2 points

Implement the func2(list_all, list_rm) function to destructively delete
from list_all all the integers that are not contained in list_rm.
The function does not considers the repetitions in list_all,
so the resulting list will not contain repetitions.

Example: if  list_all = [2, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
         and list_rm = [5, 3, 2, 7]
         list_all must be destructively changed to [2, 3, 5]

NOTA BENE: the function DOES NOT return any value! Instead, list_all
is modified in-place via side-effect.
Also, the order of items in the list should be preserved.

'''  func3: 2 points

Implement the func3(strList) that:
- takes as input a list of strings
- computes the sum of the ascii codes of the characters of each string,
obtaining an integer value for each string, and adding all the obtained
values to a list;
- returns the list of integers sorted, based on the initial string values
in the list strList, in ascending order.

For example, if strList = ["monkey", "cat", "panda", "alligator"]
the corresponding ascii values are: [659, 312, 516, 959]
that, based on the alphabetical ordering of the initial list, are returned as:
[959, 312, 659, 516]

# %%  ---- FUNC4 ----
''' func4: 5 points

    Implement the function  func4(M) that takes as argument:
    - M: a 2 dimensional matrix of integers represented as lists of lists

    The function returns the result of R + C, where:
    - R is the product of the sums of each row of M;
    - C is the product of sums of each column of M.

    Example:
        Suppose M is:
            [[1, 2, 3, 4],
             [5, 6, 7, 8],
             [9, 0, 1, 2]]
        then, the sums computed on its rows are 10, 26, 12, and their product is 3120;
        the sums computed on its columns are 15, 8, 11, 14, and their product is 18480;
        so, the function returns 21600.

# %%  ---- FUNC5 ----
''' func5: 6 points

Write a function func5(points) that takes a list of (x,y) coordinates
of N points in the Cartesian plane (N >= 3). Each point is a pair of integers.
For each point, we consider its distance from the center of the plane (0,0).

The function must return, as a tuple, the barycenter (X, Y) of the 3 points that are closer to
the center of the plane (0, 0). In case more than 3 points at the same minimum distance occur
-- e.g., [(0, 2), (2, 0), ... (-2, 0), (0, -2), ...] --
take the ones that occur first in the list
-- in the example: [(0, 2), (2, 0), (-2, 0)] --.
All values should be reported to an accuracy of 3 decimal places (you can use
the round function to do that).

  - NOTE: The distance between 2 points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
    is the Euclidean distance: sqrt[(x1-x2)² + (y1-y2)²]
  - NOTE: The barycenter of N points is the point (X', Y'),
    where X' is the mean of the x coordinates and Y' is the mean
    of the y coordinates of the N points.

For example, if points = [(2, 2), (-1, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (2, -1)]
the corresponding (unsorted) distances are: 2.828, 1.414, 3.0, 3.606, 2.236
and, after sorting them, the resulting barycenter of the 3 points
closest to (0, 0) is: (1.0, 0.667)

Ex1: 6 points
    Implement the ex1(root, result) function, recursive or using
    recursive functions, with 2 arguments:
    - root:  the root of a binary tree;
    - result: an empty list, that will be populated with the result (see below).

    The tree is made of instances of the BinaryTree class defined in tree.py.
    The function should populate the list "result",
    in which each i-th item contains the sum of all the nodes at depth i
    (the root of the tree is at depth 0).
    
    Important: the function DOES NOT return any list! Instead, result is
    populated in-place.

Ex2: 6 + 3 points
    Implement the ex2(dirin, words) function, recursive or using recursive
    functions or methods, having the argument:
    - dirin: the path of an existing directory
    - words: a list of words
    The function will go through dirin and all its subfolders (at any level),
    and count the occurrences of the words in the input list in all the
    text files (i.e., files having the .txt extension) found in any folder.
    A word occurs in a file, if and only if it is separated from the preceding
    or following word, if there are, by a space, a tab, or a newline character.

    (6 points) The function returns a list of pairs (word, occ), in which the first
    value of each pair is one of the words in the input list and the second
    value of the pair is the number of occurrences of that word in the text files.
    (+ 3 points) The list is sorted on the number of occurrences of the words
    (in descending order); if two or more words have the same number of occurrences,
    they are sorted alphabetically (in ascending order).
    If a word in the input list never occurs, it still has to be returned
    by the function.

    NOTICE 1: you could find useful the functions: os.listdir,
    os.path.isfile, os.mkdir, os.path.exists ...
    Instead, AVOID USING os.path.join, as on Windows it can
    provide unpredictable results; to get the full path of a file,
    you can just use path + filename.
    NOTICE 2: it is forbidden to use the os.walk function

    For example, given the folder "ex2" and if words = ["cat", "dog"]
    the function returns: [('dog', 10), ('cat', 5)]
