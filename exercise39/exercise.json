The returned list must be sorted in\n    ascending order. Moreover, at the end of the function, the numbers\n    occurring the maximum number of times must be replaced by the\n    character '*'.\n\n    For example, if table = [[3,2,1,3],[2,1,3,5],[1,3,2,1]]\n    the function returns the list [1,3] and the table becomes\n    [[*,2,*,*],[2,*,5],[*,*,2,*]].\n ",
