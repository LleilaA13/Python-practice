The i-th character of the string will be the character that\n   appears most frequently as the i-th character of the strings with\n   length k in ftext. In case of equal occurrences, the first\n   character in alphabetical order among the most frequent characters.\n   An empty string will be returned if the text file does not contain\n   words with length k.\n\n   As an example, for the text file f9.txt and k=3 the function\n   returns the string 'are' because in the f9.txt file there are the\n   following 4 strings with length 3: tre due amo ora\n",
