Func 1: 2 points

Define the function func1(dict1, dict2) that receives as arguments two
dictionaries that have integer keys and string list values.
The function must return the dictionary that contains the keys in common to
both dictionaries.
The values associated with each key are those that appear in only one of the
two lists associated with that key in the two dictionaries.
These values, without repetition, should be sorted in order of decreasing length
and in case of equality in ascending alphabetical order.

Example:
dict1 = { 1: ['a', 'bc', 'a'], 2: ['b', 'cr', 'e'], 3: ['a', 'qrt', 'st'] }
dict2 = { 1: ['a', 'cd', 'f'], 5: ['b', 'cr', 'e'], 3: ['a', 'bn', 'c'] }
the result is  { 1: ['bc', 'cd', 'f'], 3: ['qrt', 'bn', 'st', 'c'] }

Func 3: 4 points
Define the function func3(textfile_in, textfile_out) which receives as arguments:
- textfile_in: the path to a text file to read
- textfile_out: the path to a text file to create

The file at the path textfile_in contains either strings representing
floats or integers, positive or negative, separated by spaces.

The function must read the strings, sort them in descending order
based on the number of numerical digits (ignoring dot and sign), and
in case of equality in ascending value of the represented number.

Then it must write these sorted numbers into the textfile_out file,
separated by comma and space.
Finally, the function returns the number of numbers read from textfile_in.

Example:
if the file textfile_in contains the line
-23.5 17 -141 +322.7 -3227
In the textfile_out file, the function should write the line
-3227, +322.7, -141, -23.5, 17

Func 5: 8 points

Define the function func5(txt_input, width, height, png_output) that
receives as arguments:
- txt_input: the path to a file containing a list of figures to be drawn
- width: width in pixels of the image to be created
- height: height in pixels of the image to be created
- png_output: the path to a PNG image you need to create, containing the figures

The function should create a black background image and draw all the figures
indicated in the 'txt_input' file, in the order they appear in the file.

The txt_file contains, one per line, separated by spaces:
- a word indicating the type of figure to be drawn
- the three R G B components of the color to be used
- the coordinates and other parameters needed to define the figure.
There can be 2 types of figure:
- descending diagonal of a square (-45Â° direction):
    diagonalDOWN R G B x y L
    The diagonal begins at the point (x,y), heads LOW-right, and is L pixels long
- ascending diagonal of a square (+45Â° direction):
    diagonalUP R G B x y L
    The diagonal starts at the point (x,y), heads UP-right, and is L pixels long

Then it must save the obtained image in the file 'png_output' using the
images.save function.
It must also return the number of diagonals drawn of the two types
as a tuple of the two values (DIAGUP, DIAGDOWN).

NOTE: the points of the figures outside the image must be handled correctly,
in fact, negative coordinates are also allowed,
and dimensions or parameter L such that parts of the figure are outside the image.

Example: if the file func5/in_1.txt contains the 3 figures:
diagonalDOWN 0 255 0 -30 -40 110
diagonalUP 255 0 0 20 100 200
diagonalUP 0 0 255 10 120 50

running the function func5('func5/in_1.txt', 50, 100, 'func5/your_image_1.png')
will produce the figure in the file 'func5/expected_1.png'
and will return the pair (2, 1)

Ex1: recursive, 6 points

Let us define the function ex1(root, values), recursive or using recursive
functions, which receives as input
- the root 'root' of an n-ary tree defined by nodes nary_tree.NaryTree
- a list of integers 'values'
which destructively modifies the 'root' tree by adding all nodes that are at depth P
(assuming the root is at depth 0) to the value that in the 'values' list is
at index P (if it exists, otherwise they remain as they are).

The function must return the sum 'total' of all the nodes in the resulting tree.

IMPORTANT: the recursive function must be define at the outmost level,
that is, with the keyword 'def' located at the beginning of the line.

Example:
    values: [-42, -80, 68, 2, 81, 75, 54, 48, -4, 5]        to be added up:
    root:                        -7                         | -42

Ex2: recursive, 3 + 3 points
    Define the function ex2(dirin, words), recursive or using recursive
    functions, having as arguments:
    - dirin: the path to a directory
    - words: a list of words

    The function will examine dirin and all its subdirectories (at any level),
    and will count the occurrences of words in the words list in all text files
    (i.e., those having the extension .txt) in any folder.
    A word is present in a file if and only if it is separated from the preceding word
    or the next word, if any, by a space, tab, or newline character.

    (3 points)
	The function returns a list of tuples (word, occurrences),
    where the first value of each tuple is one of the words in the words list
    and the second is the number of occurrences of that word in all the text files that
    have been found.

    (+ 3 points)
	The list is sorted by the number of occurrences of the words
    (in descending order); if two or more words have the same number of occurrences,
    they are sorted alphabetically (in ascending order).
    If a word in the words list never occurs, it must still be returned by the function.

    NOTICE 1: useful functions could be os.listdir,
    os.path.isfile, os.mkdir, os.path.exists ...
    NOTICE 2: it is forbidden to use the os.walk function.
    NOTICE 3: use the '/' char as path separator (it works well in Windows, MacOS or Linux)

    For example, given folder = "ex2" and words = ["cat", "dog"]
    the function returns: [("dog", 10), ("cat", 5)]
