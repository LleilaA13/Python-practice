    "text": " \n    Implement the function es27(table, col, val) that takes as an input\n\n    - a table table represented by a list of dictionaries\n    - a string col with the name of one of the columns of the table\n    - a value val\n\n    and modifies the table removing the column col and deleting all\n    the rows with a value different from val in column col.  The\n    function returns the number of deleted rows.\n\n    For example\n    - if table = [{'name': 'Sophie', 'year': 1973 ,'tel': 5553546},\n                 {'name': 'Bruno', 'year': 1981 ,'tel': 5558432}]\n\n    - the function call es27(table, 'year', 1981) returns the number 1\n    and the table is modified in [{'name': 'Bruno','tel': 5558432}]\n\n",
