''' func1: 2 points

Implement the function func1(a_dict, word) that takes as input a
dictionary 'a_dict' and a word 'word'. Each key in the dictionary is
a string that has a list of strings as its value. The function must
remove from the dictionary all those keys associated with a list
that contains the string 'word'.  The function returns the number of
keys removed from the dictionary 'a_dict'.

Example: if a_dict = {'a':['a','b','c'], 'b':['a','b'], 'c':['a','c']}
  the invocation of func1(a_dict, 'b') must return 2 and
  a_dict must result modified to {'c':['a', 'c']}.
  In fact: the key 'a' is removed because the list ['a','b','c']
  contains 'b'; the key 'b' is also removed because the list
  ['a','b'] contains 'b'.

''' func4: 6 points

Implement the function func4(input_file, output_file) that takes in
input two strings, 'input_file' and 'output_file' representing
the paths to two files.  Within the file pointed by 'input_file'
there are on a single line a series of words (composed of
alphabetic characters) separated by commas, spaces, semicolons and by
periods.
The function must locate all the words in the file
indicated by 'input_file' and write them within a new file
indicated by 'output_file'.  The words must be written
within the file on a single line terminated by the character of
new line, separated by a space and in the following order:
    - increasing number of characters,
    - in case of a tie, in alphabetical order, regardless of
      upper and lower case
    - in case of identical words, in lexicographic order.
The function must return the number of words written in the file in
output.

Example: if the content of the file 'input_file' is as follows
Dog,cat,dog;cat.bird car

the invocation of func4('input_file', 'output_file') must write in the
'output_file' file the following line

''' func5: 8 points

Implement the function func5(input_pngfile) that takes as input
a string containing the path to a file with an image in
PNG format.
The image pointed by 'input_pngfile' contains a series of
white pixels on a black background. The function must locate all
rectangles defined by four white pixels that can be
considered the edges of those rectangles (see the
example image in func5/image01.png).

It can be assumed that:
    - each row has at most two white pixels and
    - each column has at most two white pixels.

The function must return a list containing the area of all rectangles
identified in the image, sorted by increasing size.

Example: in the image of the file func5/image01.png there are the edges of the
         rectangle (5,5), (45,5), (5,25), (45,25) with area 861
         and of the rectangle (10,10), (20,10), (10,20), (20,20) with area 121
         and there is a pixel in (31, 15), so the invocation of
         func5('func5/image01.png') must return the list [121, 861].
         The edges given above are in the format:

'''
Ex1: 6 points
Implement the recursive function ex1(directory), or that
uses a recursive function, which takes as input a string
'directory' representing the path to a directory.
The function must recursively explore the directory tree starting
from 'directory' and return a dictionary.
The keys of the dictionary are the paths to the subdirectories of
'directory', in string form.
The value of a directory key is a set of strings with the names
of those '.txt' files in 'directory' for which the first character
of the file contents is equal to the last character.
If a directory contains no .txt files with that characteristic,
then that directory does NOT appear in the dictionary.

Example: if the function is called on 'ex1/A', it returns:

{'ex1/A/B': {'b.txt'}, 'ex1/A/C': {'c.txt'}}

since ex1/A/B/b.txt and ex1/A/C/c.txt are the only files in which
the first character of the contents is equal to the last ('k' for the first,
'a' for the second file, respectively).

NOTE: It is forbidden to use the os.walk function. You can use:
  os.listdir, os.path.isfile, os.path.exists, etc.  To concatenate the
  path, use the concatenation operation with the character '/'

NOTE: We strongly recommend dividing the exercise into subproblems
  dividing into functions for each subproblem.

Ex2: 6 points
Implement the function ex2(root), recursive or that makes use of a
recursive function, that receives as input the root of
a binary tree, as defined in the `BinaryTree` class of the module
tree.py.  The input tree has strings as values.
The function must return the string resulting from the concatenation of
all the values associated with the nodes in the tree with the following rule:
  - concatenation occurs with the order LNR if the node is located
    in an even level
  - with the order RNL if the node is in an odd level
where L is the left subtree, N is the node, and R is the right subtree.
The root is assumed to be at level 0.

Example:
        ______A______                        ______A______
       |             |                      |             |
