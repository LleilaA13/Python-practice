def es76(word):
    '''Design and implement a function es76(word) such that:
    - it is recursive or uses recursive functions(s)/method(s),
    - it receives as argument a string 'word' of characters, and
    - it returns the list of all the suffixes of word.
    The elements of the returned list must be ordered by decreasing
    length.
    Remember that a suffix of a word is what you get when you delete
    0 or more initial characters of the word.

    Example: if word="fondamenti" the returned list will be:
    ['fondamenti', 'ondamenti', 'ndamenti', 'damenti', 'amenti', 'menti', 'enti', 'nti', 'ti', 'i']
