Each x key of this output\n    dictionary is associated with a set.  An integer is present in the\n    set with key x if and only if it is present in the attribute list\n    of key x for at least one dictionary in dictionariesList.\n\n    For example:\n    - if dictionariesList contains the three dictionaries\n    {'a': [1,3,5],'b':[2,3 ],'d':[3]},\n    {'a':[5,1,2,3], 'b':[2],'d':[3]},\n    {'a':[3,5], 'c':[4,1,2],'d':[4]}\n    the returned dictionary will be\n    {'a':{1,2,3,5},'b':{2,3},'d':{3,4}}\n\n",
