def es20(string1):
    '''Consider the alphabetical order of the 21 letters of the Italian alphabet:
    A – B – C – D – E – F – G – H – I – L – M – N – O – P – Q – R – S – T – U – V – Z

    we define the value of a letter as the position it has in this
    order, starting from 1 (for example the value of A is 1 while the
    value of Z is 21). 

    Design function es20(string1) that takes as an input 
  
    - string1, a string containing words composed with letters from
    the Italian alphabet, separated by a space

    - and returns the string obtained by substituting each word in
    string1 with a numeric string, representing the sum of all the
    values of the letters in that word.  No distinction is made
    between uppercase and lowercase letters.

    For example,
    - if string1='Angelo Monti Andrea Sterbini e Angelo Spognardi'
    - the function returns the string '48 63 39 88 5 48 93'
