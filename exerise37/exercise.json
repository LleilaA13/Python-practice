    "text": "Given a sequence S of integers, we define sequence derived from S\n    the sequence of n integers where the i-th element is given by the\n    sum of the first i integers of S.\n    For example: the sequence derived from \n    S= 2, -3, -4, 4, 4, -5, 3, 1.-1 is\n       2, -1, -5, -1, 3, -2, 1, 2, 1.\n    \n    Design and implement a function ex41(fname) such that:..................\n    - it takes as arguments the path of a text file 'fname', where it\n      is stored a sequence S of integers, separated by a comma and\n      some white spaces\n    - it returns the number that appears most frequently in the\n      sequence derived from S. If there are several numbers with the\n      highest number of repetitions, the maximum one is returned.\n    Example: if the 'fname' file contains the sequence S= 2, -3, -4,\n    4, -5, 3, 1, -1 the function returns the value 2.\n",
