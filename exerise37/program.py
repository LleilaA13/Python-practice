    '''Given a sequence S of integers, we define sequence derived from S
    the sequence of n integers where the i-th element is given by the
    sum of the first i integers of S.
    For example: the sequence derived from 
    S= 2, -3, -4, 4, 4, -5, 3, 1.-1 is
       2, -1, -5, -1, 3, -2, 1, 2, 1.
    
    Design and implement a function ex41(fname) such that:..................
    - it takes as arguments the path of a text file 'fname', where it
      is stored a sequence S of integers, separated by a comma and
      some white spaces
    - it returns the number that appears most frequently in the
      sequence derived from S. If there are several numbers with the
      highest number of repetitions, the maximum one is returned.
    Example: if the 'fname' file contains the sequence S= 2, -3, -4,
    4, -5, 3, 1, -1 the function returns the value 2.
