    """Define the recursive function (or a function that uses your own
    recursive function) es71(dir, minimum, maximum) that searches in
    the directory dir the files that have a size between minimum and
    maximum size (included).  The function returns a dictionary that
    contains the names of the identified files (without path) as keys,
    and the corresponding depths (counting the initial directory 'dir'
    as depth 0) as values.  In case a file name is present at
    different depths, the dictionary must contain the greater one.
    Note: to find the size of the file you can use the os.stat
    function
